""" Codename Q1A-MX (Erma)
Another implementation of the OpenAI API to create a simple chatbot.
- This chatbot can be assigned a name, AI_NAME.
- Upon creation, a system prompt is assigned to SYSTEM_PROMPT.
- Messages later passed to the api request usually are assigned to CONVO, which is a *list of dicts*.
    The first dict is the SYSTEM_PROMPT.
    Later entries are dicts of KEY assistant/user and VALUE message.
    An example is shown below:
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "hey gpt, can you tell me a joke?"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field."
      },
- The Q1A-MX is a special type of doll due to their usage of the Summer Garden, which is a place 
  where memories can be tied to certain words, or keys. An example of this concept is illustrated below:
      "Manager: Congratulations on your fine taste. This is the latest model of second-generation Doll, the Q1A-MX."
      "Q1A-MX: Who's the Q1A-MX? Me?"
      "Q1A-MX: Who am I...?"
      Just then, her sleeve slides down and the sunlight illuminates her arm, revealing a band of densely-packed 
      encrypted text that looks like jewelry. She selects the simplest characters and searches for them in her neural cloud. 
      "Q1A-MX: Erma?"
      "Q1A-MX: Erma? ...I am Erma."
      (Girl's Frontline: Longitudinal Strain [Event 13-3])
- In this script's implementation, GARDEN is a list of dicts, the dict keys being garden KEYS, 
  and their VALUES being a summarized memory string.
- Memories thus can be restored to the chatbot by invoking a key in the garden (just mention it in user/AI input), 
  then the VALUE is loaded into the CONVO under the assistant tag.
- All of this is saved to a file, which is NCB. It is referred to FILENAME later on in the script.
- Special commands can be inputted by the user, which are stored in COMMAND_CHECK()
- Users and the chatbot are able to compact the neural cloud with SUMMARIZE(), saving request tokens.
- To use, first define NCB (main neuralcloud file, responsible for holding past conversations and the summer garden),
  AI_FILE, a file to write AI responses to,
  and USER_FILE, a file where users can write their inputs to.
- To start the conversation, START() is called with the model name (ex. 'gpt3.5-turbo') and the BRIDGE_ACTIVE.
  BRIDGE_ACTIVE is either True or False, and determines whether the AI_FILE and USER_FILE should be used.
- If BRIDGE_ACTIVE is True, then the script waits for USER_FILE to be written to. This could be done manually,
  or through another script. Once USER_FILE is modified, this script reads the contents and uses it as the user's input.
  This input is then sent to the API, which returns a response that is thus written to AI_FILE. This cycle then repeats."""
